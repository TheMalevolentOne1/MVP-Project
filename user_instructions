# How to Use!

Welcome to your first note in your Adaptive Study Cipher planner journey!

## Writing Headings
Use one or more `#` symbols at the start of a line to create headings:
```
# Main Heading
## Subheading
### Smaller Heading
```

## Emphasis
*Italics text* is produced by wrapping text in single asterisks or underscores:
```
*Italics text* or _Italics text_
```

**Bold text** is produced by wrapping text in double asterisks or underscores:
```
**Bold text** or __Bold text__
```

## Lists
Create bullet lists using dashes, pluses, or asterisks:
```
- Item 1
- Item 2
```

## Code
Inline code: `code here`
